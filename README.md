Our solution for the NASA Space Apps 2023 Planetary Tourism Office challenge is an interactive 3D game in Unity. It enables users to embark on a tourism tour across planets, leveraging NASA images and information. Each level represents a specific planet, offering a unique and educational experience. 
Players can explore the planets, learn about their characteristics, and browse various destinations within the game.
